## 🏁 Getting Started

### 1. Firebase Setup

This project is fully integrated with Firebase. To run it, you must connect it to your own Firebase project.

1.  Create a new project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2.  **Enable** the following services:
    * **Authentication** (with the Email/Password sign-in method turned on).
    * **Firestore Database** (start in test mode for now).
    * **Storage**.
3.  Add **Android** and **Web** apps to your project.
    * For **Android**, the package name **must** be `com.example.campus_track`.
4.  Install the Firebase CLI and FlutterFire CLI:
    ```bash
    npm install -g firebase-tools
    dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
    ```
5.  Log in to Firebase in your terminal:
    ```bash
    firebase login
    ```
6.  Run `flutterfire configure` from the project root to connect your app.
    ```bash
    flutterfire configure
    ```
    > **Note:** Select your new project. When it asks to overwrite files, say **Yes**.
7.  Manually update the Firebase config in `web/firebase-messaging-sw.js` with the one from your Firebase project settings.

### 2. Add Firestore Security Rules

Your app will not work without security rules.

1.  In the Firebase console, go to **Firestore Database** > **Rules**.
2.  Copy the entire content of the `firestore.rules` file (included in this repo or provided separately) and paste it into the editor.
3.  Click **Publish**.

### 3. Seed the Database (CRITICAL)

Your new database is empty. You must run the seeder script to add all the users, subjects, and timetables.

> **IMPORTANT:** For the seeder to work, you must *temporarily* open your Firestore rules.

1.  In the **Rules** tab of your Firestore console, change the rules to:
    ```javascript
    rules_version = '2';
    service cloud.firestore {
      match /databases/{database}/documents {
        match /{document=**} {
          allow read, write: if true;
        }
      }
    }
    ```
2.  Click **Publish**.
3.  Run the seeder script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    flutter run -t bin/run_seeder.dart
    ```
4.  Wait for it to print `✅ Seeding complete!`.
5.  **IMMEDIATELY** go back to the Firebase console, delete the temporary rules, and paste your **secure rules** back in. Click **Publish**.

### 4. Run the App

You're all set. You can now run the app normally.

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
